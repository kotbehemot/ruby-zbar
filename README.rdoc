* Added ability to use internal zbar conversion
* Fixed an error with null-pointers in the FFI method call

== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby bindings for ZBar, a barcode recognition library.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'zbar'
  
  ZBar::Image.from_jpeg(File.read('test.jpg')).process
  => [#<Zbar::Symbol:0x10147c668
    @addon="",
    @data="9876543210128",
    @location= [...],
    @quality=15,
    @symbology="EAN-13">]

== REQUIREMENTS:

* FFI
* ZBar, probably 0.10 or more

ZBar can be obtained from http://zbar.sourceforge.net.

== DOWNLOAD/INSTALL:

From gemcutter:

  [sudo] gem install zbar
  
From github:

  git clone git://github.com/delta407/ruby-zbar.git
  cd ruby-zbar
  rake install

== LIMITATIONS:

Doesn't expose all ZBar functionality, including:
* No video functions
* No low-level interfaces (scanner, decoder)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
